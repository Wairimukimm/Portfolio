This is my first blog post on my new portfolio website!

I have never loved time series. In fact I only read the topic enough to pass my exams until I realized I could not escape the concept of time as it is everywhere I look no matter how hard I was trying to avoid it. Anyway lemme not bore you with my story and let’s get into the depth that is time series.

While many of us are aware of the models like ARIMA and the concept of time series, I realized there is so much that one needs to take into consideration when choosing a time series model. Recently I came across VECM models while looking for a way to model cointegrated multivariate time series data. This made me go into deep research on time series as a whole uncovering a wealth of knowledge I hadn’t anticipated.

So, I invite you to come along with me as I will be dissecting time series over the coming weeks. We’ll delve into the critical decisions one must make before selecting a model and explore various models in detail. At the end I will build a VECM model and I will deploy it for anyone to use it. Let’s embark on this exploration together!
